            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>Focus areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whenever facing SMGS if possible try to maintain and increase your distance between you and the enemy if you have a Deagle</li>
                    <li>Get a teammate to follow you when you are going agro, I am not saying stop going agro but get someone to follow you so they can trade, having someone following you can help in multiple ways such as boosting your confidence in the actual fight because if you die you don't have to worry about having a meaningless death.</li>
                    <li>When running up second middle expect the apps peek and have your weapon out, honestly the 1 second it will add to your apps push it worth it when you consider if they peek with a flash and you have no gun you are dead.</li>
                    <li>Banana aggression is one of your favorite things to do and if you get a teammate to flash and someone to follow you this can hugely increase your chances of this play working more consistently.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you drop utility and there is a chance of an enemy being close try to hide or move out of LOS (line of sight) so if they do peek trying to catch you without your gun, you are safe.</li>
                    <li>When sitting behind a smoke make sure you are not in line of a common angle otherwise you stand a high chance of getting spammed.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you are low try to play passive as just having your presence in the round is intimidating because 3v2 looks alot scarier than 2v2 with one -20 hp from you attempting to kill them.</li>
                    <li>If you see the enemies are playing aggressive always judge whether you will be able to get the utility down before they peek as if they peek and see you holding utility that is a free kill for them and a gun in your hand will usually always do more damage than a nade/flash/smoke.</li>
                    <li>Generally speaking aggression when the enemy is on a light buy is not optimal as in most situations you will be closing the distance and weaker weapons are more effective at closer range, just something to be aware of.</li>
                    <li>One of the most important skills to master is visualization at a glance of the mini-map you should be able to understand all the open positons and all the positions your teammates are covering and all the possible positions an enemy could be at, there were a few times when you were caught off-guard from enemies being in positions that were unexpected or positions you thought your teamamtes were holding.</li>

                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <h3>Match : Inferno</h3>
                <p>Starting T side</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>P250 flash, good attempt at using the p250s accuracy to try and entry but peeks were not focused and flash was wasted. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice idea to use ramp to extend the range and use that deagle long range accuracy to your advantage but do not crouch into the angle instead stand on ramp and if the enemy peeks and you don't keep him to crouching to hide instantly, you closed the distance between you and the smg and with a deagle this is a bad idea but because you had no body armour this was an impossible fight to win. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, getting into b long was nice but you didn't expect and enemy close and because you didn't have any body Armour and you were so close to a smg it was a incredibly difficult fight to win.</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice job getting into banana but you were overly aggressive getting into a fight top banana while Noone was helping you and the rest of your team was middle and apps, the opponent had the better peek. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, dangerous fully running up second middle as you are completely exposed to an apps play without your gun, fortunately they didn't peek, when you were coming out apps your pathing was alright but you didn't clear the right angles as you are in apps you focus on pit and balcony when you come out you focus on sight and then mini. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again taking banana solo early but fortunately there was Noone fighting, nice pathing onto site and good angle clearing allowed you to easily kill the enemy first orange. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a bit of a dangerous and wasted flash top banana, good reaction and solid entry kill, good second kill and nice positioning. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again going up banana solo and nearly punished by a deagle, good job slowing down to wait for your teammates to catch up, solid after plant positon in front of dark. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again going up banana solo and you did get punished by an awp peek and because you were solo there was Noone to trade you. L </li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice flash CT but unfortunately you team stalled top banana and couldn't counter the awp coffins fast enough. L</li>
                    <li>Tec9, amazing double entry top banana and then another sick double, overall a fantastic quad kill on an eco and tjis round you had a 50% accuracy which is amazing . W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice aggression middle and solid kill early in the round, good positioning and spamming top banana allows you to secure a second and good positioning Mexico late in the round allows you to secure a third and overall a very good round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfortunately while you were top middle you dropped a smoke and didn't hide and then the enemy peeked while you still didn't have a weapon and your didn't was not able to protect you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, late Molly banana could have been dangerous, good reaction killing the enemy in boiler and then killing his teammate in apps who was shooting st your teammate, unfortunately your positon got communicated and the enemy dropped a grenade boiler which killed you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility combo on B, CT smoke, family Molly, CT flash, unfortunately you heard the A call a bit too late and you peeked into an awper coffins. W</li>
                    <li>Ct Pistol Armour, solid spam kill on the enemy first oranges and then the enemy peeked you from ruins and got a good off angle. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, good attempt at using the smoke but unfortunately the positon you decided to sit it was a common spam for the corner behind you so the enemy got lucky and spammed you straight through thr smoke. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good play with the Molly middle and then the repeek but after your first fight the enemy got you really low so it was extremely dangerous going for thr second in that situation but you managed to pull it off, unfortunately with low time and more pressure you were not able to win the clutch. L</li>
                    <li>Scout, I liked the peek down middle and holding the angle second middle but you should not have repeeked as the enemy was expecting this and then once he shot you once because you had no Armour you were slowed so much you couldn't move. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting angle infront of mid smoke to look deep into apps, unfortunate peek timings were the reason you took so much damage and felt like you never really got into a fight. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice try at getting the Juan deag down middle but the enemy in Mexico has a huge advantage in that fight. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, first of the game, unfortunately you teammates were toxic about it, then the enemy arch forced you into playing lane with the awp which is not optimal, you played slightly dangerous but it's okay. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good holding second middle from top allowing you to secure an easy kill, nice attempt at getting a trade kill for your arch player but you slightly over flicked 3 times, and your timing when peeking arch was off allowing the enemy to get behind you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, you saw the enemies were playing fast but you pulling out your utility meant the enemy could peek without fearing you and kill your teammate lane, fortunately you were able to swiftly trade him and solid second. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting aggression doen middle while the enemies were on a light buy, you managed to catch one off guard before getting traded yourself by an enemy hiding in a corner. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice kill ramp, but maybe a little more minimal awareness as your teammate was in second middle and you were still holding the second middle peek. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good attempt at flashing banana for him, good use of angles to allow yourself to get multiple peeks into top banana while staying quite safe, unfortunately you got overly confident and didn't know where the enemies were after you rotated to arch and when you peeked they heard and were able to instantly prefire you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good aggression middle and solid reactions to get a double kill butyou went overly agro and peeked banana super wide and into a double peek which allowed them to kill you fortunately your teammate was able to trade you a bit later in the round.</li>

            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>Focus areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When engaging against light buys or eco buys generally it is better to play a slower style as this allows you more time to figure out where the enemies are and pick and choose your engagments more carefully as closing the distance against these kinds of buys is not recommended.</li>
                    <li>Conditioning enemies works best when the utility thrown forces them to react in a certain way, if they are outright able to dodge or ignore it then it has little to no effect on the game, if the utility thrown changes the way the enemy has to play this is effective as it allows you to more easily predict what they will do.</li>
                    <li>When prefiring with the M4a1s be highly aware of the limited number of bullets as if you get into an actual engagment after your prefire you want to have enough bullets to deal with 1 or 2 enemies.</li>
                    <li>When picking positions you should try to mentally rank positions: common angles -1 / off angle +1 / headshot angles +1 / cover +1 / no cover -1 / and so on this will allow you to take an unemotional look at the positions you are commonly playing</li>
                    <li>Keep your protocols sharp, I can see on B you usually have a set plan with the early molly and flash to counter any signs of aggression, but sometimes it wasn't executed properly and these were actually the rounds were the enemies came B which could have resulted in you being caught off-guard.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <h3>Match : Dust2</h3>
                <p>Starting T side</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>P250 smoke flash, good use of flash to get your teammates out long and nice smoke to cover the cross, unfortunately predictable movement led to you being prefired by a CT engaging with your teammates, generally speaking when playing with the p250 you are extremely vulnerable to any direct fights as 3 or 4 well placed usp body shots will kill you and the aim punch from having no Armour makes it almost impossible to fight anyone who has realized you don't have body armour, in this situation I would have put more emphasis on getting into pit, using the range accuracy of the p250 and the relative safely of the headshot angle that is the pit angle. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice attempt at hitting the long corner prefire and fortunately they gave it up allowing for you to get into the pit angle which gives you a huge advantage, nice trade on the enemy flanking long, good angle play killing the guy on short but unfortunately you didn't properly clear CT as you had minimal time left. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice corner smoke and long utility to fake presence, while your team setup for a B execute, unfortunately they took to long to execute which allowed the CTs to push into an extremely strong 1:2:1:1 setup which allows for 3 CTs to be on B at a moments notice forcing your team to change plans and spread out, interesting choice to just try a raw aim duel on B platform while your teammates were setting up for a short take. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility again long, almost getting caught off-guard by an enemy pushing middle fortunately you had 1 teammate holding it, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, rush out long against an eco is not a good idea as you are actively coming through a chokepoint against pistols and SMGS and the fact that you crouched in the doorway long preventing any of your teammates from also fighting and this meant that it was you against all 5 and an unfortunate panic spray caused some misses. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, some useful utility out long and cross smoke, dangerous decision to entry onto A site with the bomb unfortunately you started shooting before your crosshair was on the enemy making your spray significantly hard than it would have been otherwise. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, I understand you are trying to condition the enemies with the flashes long but if there is nothing else they are not going to be conditions to dodging your same flashes when you actually do take long because rhey are still peeking, but nice rotate and overall solid B take, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Xbox smoke this is the first time taking on middle, unfortunately the enemies is at a good off angle short with the awp catches you crossing middle. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility up short mollying site and the left side flashes, unfortunately due to no presence long or middle this allowed the enemy long to flank and kill you and one of your teammates. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good positoning to backup your teammate coming out long and pushing site, nice positioning behind a site sacks and good spray control on the enemy short, overall solid round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, missed flash Long, solid kill long corner, dangerous choice to jiggle peek long while on low hp without your teammates close but fortunately you were not punished, fantastic off angle top middle catching the enemy rotating short to lower completely off guard. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, long push attempt, usually during pugs it can be extremely hard to have faith in your teammates flashes so I would recommend dropping your own as you come out long because during this round you peeked long raw and both enemies were looking right at you not blind, unfortunately this was an eco buy so it was not the right round to go hyper aggressive as you are closing the distance between the smgs and pistols. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, wasted flash long as your teammate didn't peek off your flash and it had no effect on the round, the enemy player at an off angle further up short than you expect so while your crosshair was towards site the enemy was closer to Rice baskets. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, b rush, nice dink and kill on the enemy close tunnels solid trade kill, nice attempt at getting the second you were on a headshot angle to start the fight but you moved into a more exposed positon which the enemy was easily able to deal some bodyshots causing your crosshair to jump. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice Xbox smoke, quick reactions to kill the enemy right as you came out the smoke, again good reactions to kill the enemy pushing you through the cross smoke, you initially had the right idea unfortunately the clutch didn't go your way. L</li>
                    <li>CT Pistol Armour, really nice play going lowers allowing you to get alot of information and flank, while you were flanking long I think you were surprised by the enemies positon and started tapping a bit fast so your usp wasn't entirely accurate. L </li>
                    <li>Full save,again lowers push allowing you to head all the enemies in tunnels allowing for a quick rotate, unfortunately with only a usp it was hard to have impact. L </li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at taking long but your prefire resulted an extended spray which the m4a1s is not optimized for with its reduced bullet capacity, this led to you taking an actual engagement but dying shortly afterwards because of low bullets. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice Molly long but your flash was very short, your positioning in this engagement was off if you wanted to fight long you should have done so while thr smoke was falling but unfortunately when the enemies short peeked you there was not alot you could do as you were over exposed and had the weaker weaponry so this alone put you at a huge disadvantage in this fight. L</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, flash throw positioning was very exposed as the enemies peeked tunnels, good adjustment and burst timing to get the first kill, unfortunately with your restricted positioning on catwalk the enemies knew exactly where to were and managed to get the trade kill on you. W</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, utility on B didn't seem very protocol based instead it was reactionary and kind of random, but fortunately you got the Molly down early enough to stop the proper push only allowing 1 to get out, which you dealt with, one of my suggestions is when the enemies are at bay like stuck behind a Molly instead of dropping flashed reload your mp9 first as this will aid you if you get into a second fight before you expect it, nice flash middle late round allowing multiple teammates to peek thr enemy short. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, your B protocols look sharp this round with a nice early Molly and quick decisive positioning, no action. W </li>
                    <li>Full buy, no action. W </li>
                    <li>Full buy, good patience on B and not getting complacent, and nice kill on the enemy tunnels. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good awareness to check your angles as you rotated up short, nice burst on the enemy long from A site, good retake with solid utility and a nice flick for thr enemies unexpected angle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, when rotating CT you were holding the right side long even though your teammate in pit could see that is was clear, this caused you to slow downa bit in your retake but in this situation I would just recommend as a 2v4 situation when the bomb is thay far ticked is just a waste of time and money, good job saving the awp. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job noticing the gap left in middle after your teammate died early and peeking allowing you to catch 1 enemy moving up catwalk almost completely off guard, and good awareness to know that exposing you were playing middle the enemies might think B will be open and take advantage unfortunately you were caught slightly out of positon by an awp moving out tunnels.

                <p>Starting T side</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol Armour, lowers play, great information play, and fantastic positioning to hold the cat aggression but unfortunately, you didn't expect a second enemy up catwalk and this made it easy for them to get a delayed trade on you. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, really good position choice playing the headshot angle ramp, making the enemies life difficult and solid tapping unfortunately you slightly overextended by exposing yourself but solid damage and good choices. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, missed tunnels smoke, your patience was good until the end which is when you got timinged as you stopped holding tunnels the enemy pushed through, your rotate wasn't necessary as not all the enemy positions were known and this left you are your teammates open to a flank which is what happened, and then they took B. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, unfortunate timing on repositioning led to you taking a lot of damage from a grenade and spam leaving you at 22hp before you saw anyone, solid reposition and a good attempt at using the smoke to catch people off guard which is what you did but you couldn't capitalize on the first but after a bit of spam you managed to hit a nice shot but were quickly traded. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, positioning seems to be a little odd but good job realizing the situation, when your teammates died long, good job getting one unfortunately you were quickly traded from the second enemy on site. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, being Solo B with no utility is always difficult, good job securing an easy double kill allowing for your teammates to close in the distance and flank, although things got a little sketchy towards the end of the round, managing to close it out. W</li>
                    <li>Ak buy, Nice job being ready to support your teammates taking long with a flash but nice ability to save the flash and not waste it preemptively, I like the way you are playing pit, very passively and mainly off sound and using utility to allow for you to repeek, very clean first kill but when you were fighting the second enemy by Blue container, there were not solid peeks taken until after you got dinked and then, unfortunately, you accidentally overexposed yourself so instead of using the headshot angle you showed too much of your body allowing the enemy to kill you without a second headshot. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice peek middle but unfortunately, you were unable to capitalize on any of their mistakes, good attempt at saving and great awareness to catch someone slow peeking at you from an unexpected angle. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice use of tight angles to get information and great patience to hold angles even when there are targets but waiting for the right opportunity, solid kill on the enemy top middle and good awareness to watch for short and long plays but your peek long wasn’t focused and seemed lazy as you didn’t break it down into any smaller peeks instead peeking the entirety of long at once which got you punished. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good job backing up your teammate on short with a molly and smoke, nice patience holding short for so long and focused, good quick kill on the enemy peeking short, nice short flash for your teammate. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice holding short and dodging flashes, unfortunately, you repeeked from a predictable angle and the enemy awper was able to hold your repeek and kill you. L</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, nice damage on one long. W</li>
                    <li>Rifle buy, interesting aggression into tunnels while the enemy was on a weak buy, because closing the distance against pistols is never a good idea but you managed to catch them completely off-guard and kill 2 in tunnels. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice play going lowers, unfortunately, you were not ready for the first enemy peeking top stairs because he walked, you did good damage but it wasn’t enough, your teammate was able to get a swift trade though. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice quick trade on the enemy that killed your teammate long, good job staying active and focused on long, nice support Molly delaying the enemies short take, good quick reaction and solid second kill. W</li>
                    <li>P250 flash, smoke (T side), nice quick kill and solid use of utility for smoking door and flashing on the entry fantastic overall round. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, nice flank positioning allowing you to catch an enemy rotating up short and solid bursting to kill the second enemy short. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice long flashes supporting your teammates, good trade on the enemy long, and solid use of utility with the cross smokes and site molly, unfortunately, it looked like you were not aware of planting on that position exposed you to being jump shot. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, B rush! nice early smoke to counter the molly and a bit of a messy spray on the first enemy but you managed to secure the kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly car clearing that position, nice focus on the smoke expecting an enemy to make a play through it, and nice prefireing on the enemy short which worked perfectly. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Really solid entry pathways on long peeking the enemy close perfectly and then getting the follow-up kill very cleanly, unfortunately, your crosshair placement was slightly off as you went up to site and this caused the enemy on-site to have the advantage in that engagement against you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, early peeking lowers caused you to be double peeked by an enemy aggressive short and lowers, if you had delayed this peek slightly your teammates top middle would have dealt with the enemy agro short, so you would have had to only focus on the one lowers. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice aggression on the enemy middle and it looked like you knew exactly what you wanted to do, good damage and nice plant B, unfortunate timing on the change of angles from tunnels to window. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice flashes long unfortunately the enemies went hyper agro middle which allowed them to kill 3 of you without really fighting back, it was at this point that Kanylen left. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, good job peeking CT, really really nice juan deag killing the enemy holding the cross, and good job being aware of the long flank which allowed you to catch an enemy completely off-guard, solid third kill and good triple. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, Good kill on the enemy awper peeking middle and fantastic second headshot kill on the enemy peeking close doors. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good job holding the cross and getting information, really nice demonstration of your raw aiming ability dealing with the full save long rush, killing 3 with some good shots, and then in the same round missing against an enemy walking in tunnels who you had time to aim at, which shows much volatile aim is. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, unfortunately, you got out peeked by an enemy peeking middle with an AWP. L</li>
