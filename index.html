            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>Focus areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whenever facing SMGS if possible try to maintain and increase your distance between you and the enemy if you have a Deagle</li>
                    <li>Get a teammate to follow you when you are going agro, I am not saying stop going agro but get someone to follow you so they can trade, having someone following you can help in multiple ways such as boosting your confidence in the actual fight because if you die you don't have to worry about having a meaningless death.</li>
                    <li>When running up second middle expect the apps peek and have your weapon out, honestly the 1 second it will add to your apps push it worth it when you consider if they peek with a flash and you have no gun you are dead.</li>
                    <li>Banana aggression is one of your favorite things to do and if you get a teammate to flash and someone to follow you this can hugely increase your chances of this play working more consistently.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you drop utility and there is a chance of an enemy being close try to hide or move out of LOS (line of sight) so if they do peek trying to catch you without your gun, you are safe.</li>
                    <li>When sitting behind a smoke make sure you are not in line of a common angle otherwise you stand a high chance of getting spammed.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you are low try to play passive as just having your presence in the round is intimidating because 3v2 looks alot scarier than 2v2 with one -20 hp from you attempting to kill them.</li>
                    <li>If you see the enemies are playing aggressive always judge whether you will be able to get the utility down before they peek as if they peek and see you holding utility that is a free kill for them and a gun in your hand will usually always do more damage than a nade/flash/smoke.</li>
                    <li>Generally speaking aggression when the enemy is on a light buy is not optimal as in most situations you will be closing the distance and weaker weapons are more effective at closer range, just something to be aware of.</li>
                    <li>One of the most important skills to master is visualization at a glance of the mini-map you should be able to understand all the open positons and all the positions your teammates are covering and all the possible positions an enemy could be at, there were a few times when you were caught off-guard from enemies being in positions that were unexpected or positions you thought your teamamtes were holding.</li>

                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <h3>Match : Inferno</h3>
                <p>Starting T side</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>P250 flash, good attempt at using the p250s accuracy to try and entry but peeks were not focused and flash was wasted. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice idea to use ramp to extend the range and use that deagle long range accuracy to your advantage but do not crouch into the angle instead stand on ramp and if the enemy peeks and you don't keep him to crouching to hide instantly, you closed the distance between you and the smg and with a deagle this is a bad idea but because you had no body armour this was an impossible fight to win. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, getting into b long was nice but you didn't expect and enemy close and because you didn't have any body Armour and you were so close to a smg it was a incredibly difficult fight to win.</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice job getting into banana but you were overly aggressive getting into a fight top banana while Noone was helping you and the rest of your team was middle and apps, the opponent had the better peek. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, dangerous fully running up second middle as you are completely exposed to an apps play without your gun, fortunately they didn't peek, when you were coming out apps your pathing was alright but you didn't clear the right angles as you are in apps you focus on pit and balcony when you come out you focus on sight and then mini. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again taking banana solo early but fortunately there was Noone fighting, nice pathing onto site and good angle clearing allowed you to easily kill the enemy first orange. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a bit of a dangerous and wasted flash top banana, good reaction and solid entry kill, good second kill and nice positioning. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again going up banana solo and nearly punished by a deagle, good job slowing down to wait for your teammates to catch up, solid after plant positon in front of dark. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again going up banana solo and you did get punished by an awp peek and because you were solo there was Noone to trade you. L </li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice flash CT but unfortunately you team stalled top banana and couldn't counter the awp coffins fast enough. L</li>
                    <li>Tec9, amazing double entry top banana and then another sick double, overall a fantastic quad kill on an eco and tjis round you had a 50% accuracy which is amazing . W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice aggression middle and solid kill early in the round, good positioning and spamming top banana allows you to secure a second and good positioning Mexico late in the round allows you to secure a third and overall a very good round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfortunately while you were top middle you dropped a smoke and didn't hide and then the enemy peeked while you still didn't have a weapon and your didn't was not able to protect you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, late Molly banana could have been dangerous, good reaction killing the enemy in boiler and then killing his teammate in apps who was shooting st your teammate, unfortunately your positon got communicated and the enemy dropped a grenade boiler which killed you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility combo on B, CT smoke, family Molly, CT flash, unfortunately you heard the A call a bit too late and you peeked into an awper coffins. W</li>
                    <li>Ct Pistol Armour, solid spam kill on the enemy first oranges and then the enemy peeked you from ruins and got a good off angle. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, good attempt at using the smoke but unfortunately the positon you decided to sit it was a common spam for the corner behind you so the enemy got lucky and spammed you straight through thr smoke. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good play with the Molly middle and then the repeek but after your first fight the enemy got you really low so it was extremely dangerous going for thr second in that situation but you managed to pull it off, unfortunately with low time and more pressure you were not able to win the clutch. L</li>
                    <li>Scout, I liked the peek down middle and holding the angle second middle but you should not have repeeked as the enemy was expecting this and then once he shot you once because you had no Armour you were slowed so much you couldn't move. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting angle infront of mid smoke to look deep into apps, unfortunate peek timings were the reason you took so much damage and felt like you never really got into a fight. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice try at getting the Juan deag down middle but the enemy in Mexico has a huge advantage in that fight. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, first of the game, unfortunately you teammates were toxic about it, then the enemy arch forced you into playing lane with the awp which is not optimal, you played slightly dangerous but it's okay. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good holding second middle from top allowing you to secure an easy kill, nice attempt at getting a trade kill for your arch player but you slightly over flicked 3 times, and your timing when peeking arch was off allowing the enemy to get behind you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, you saw the enemies were playing fast but you pulling out your utility meant the enemy could peek without fearing you and kill your teammate lane, fortunately you were able to swiftly trade him and solid second. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting aggression doen middle while the enemies were on a light buy, you managed to catch one off guard before getting traded yourself by an enemy hiding in a corner. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice kill ramp, but maybe a little more minimal awareness as your teammate was in second middle and you were still holding the second middle peek. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good attempt at flashing banana for him, good use of angles to allow yourself to get multiple peeks into top banana while staying quite safe, unfortunately you got overly confident and didn't know where the enemies were after you rotated to arch and when you peeked they heard and were able to instantly prefire you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good aggression middle and solid reactions to get a double kill butyou went overly agro and peeked banana super wide and into a double peek which allowed them to kill you fortunately your teammate was able to trade you a bit later in the round.</li>
