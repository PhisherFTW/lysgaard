            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I can clearly see that larger flicks and tracking enemies is quite clearly uncomfortable and strained the reason you probably don't feel it is because you have gotten used to the sens but it is obvious when watching you, this will lead to you losing more fights that are outside of the "Comfortable" zone for flicking on your sens, with a lower sens this comfort zone gets increasingly smaller and smaller.</li>
                    <li>I understand that copying the pro settings is not going to immediately make you better but there are several reasons these professionals pick their sensitivity and its not just because it felt good, currently out of about 400 professional players only 6 use below 500edpi and you are currently on 337.5 and the average is 800edpi</li>
                    <li>The position you play on T side as an entry, is not compatible with low sens at a high level, this is because as an entry you are required to clear many angles as quickly and efficiently as possible and having such a low sens will cause you to do what's called "lazy" clearing this is when you do the motions but are not focused on every peek and when an enemy is in the angle you are clearing they will have the advantage, also again looking at the professionals you will notice that the vast majority of dedicated entry players have an average edpi of 750-950 and this is for a good reason as at this sens they can full focus clear every angle without having to do extreme swipes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use Utility lineups wherever possible as this will increase the consistency if where they land and this will thus increase your consistency in plays you do involving the utility.</li>
                    <li>Put yourself in positions to BE traded and TO trade your teammates, if you notice someone is going agro go with them to back them up this will allow them to be more confident in any fights they take as they trust you to kill the enemy that does kill them, also make sure that you are not too close as this makes it easy for the enemy to get a double spray kill or too far as this will allow the enemy to escape before you can shoot at them and trade, so constantly monitor and adjust your positioning from your teammate to allow you to be within an optimal range for trading, alternatively try to get someone to follow you as much as possible as make sure you keep yourself within their tradable range, don’t go to far too fast otherwise when you do engage an enemy and die you teammate will be too far to trade you.</li>
                    <li> When dropping utility, make sure 95% of the time you are only throwing it when you are completely safe and there is no chance of an enemy peeking you while you have utility out, because Guns will always do more damage than any utility you throw, Utility should be used for damaging people in positions you can’t see, not ones you can. IF you do need to throw a dangerous piece of utility that exposes you, make sure you clear the angle first making sure there is no signs of an enemy, no jiggle peeking, etc and then as quickly as possible pull out the utility line it up and throw it as soon as the utility leaves your hand, duck behind cover and pull out your weapon, it is very common for an enemy to peek the exact position from where a piece of utility has been throw as you have effectively given up your positional advantage.</li>
                    <li>When on Pistols (Not Deagle) and SMGS, it is important to play angles that allow you to take full advantage of them, and using the “Throwing distance” we can easily picture whether an angle will be within the optimal range for our weapons, I want you to focus on always putting yourself in an advantageous fight whenever possible and this means using off-angles, and using positions that allow your weapons the highest chance of success.</li>
                    <li>Practise Rifle spray patterns and I recommend starting to use the “Spray for the head” Technique this involves changing your spray pattern slightly as most players after the first 3-5 bullets pull down to the chest, the above technique forces you to keep your spay high and aim for headshots, this is a technique that all professional players are using now as it is incredibly deadly and allows for more consist kills than bursting or tapping, I recommend practising this technique exclusively in Normal FFA Deathmatch (Not headshot only) against real players, as this will allow your practised technique to transfer to the real game a lot better.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Match : NUKE</h3>
                <p>Starting T side</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, good entry on Door killing the guy mouth, fantastic reposition to site instantly killing one heaven, and quick trade killing the third hut. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good trade mouth, interesting rotation from heaven to A main when teammates were on A site, but good clutch. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, outside first smoke could be better with a lineup, nearly a spray wiff on the enemy coming out mouth but you managed to recover, bad repostion lowers by double door stairs for no reason unnecessarily exposing yourself to secret when the enemy position was still unknown. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, unfortunate timing on pulling out utility got you severely damaged but you managed to recover and get the kill, unfortunately you soon got traded by his teammates. L</li>
                    <li>P250 armour, Good job getting onto site but got panicked and started taking too many and bad fights with the p250 at range. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, While dropping the molly door you were overly exposed which could have gotten you killed, good play ramp pushing through their bad smoke and getting a good timing catching the player under heaven, solid cover on B killing the enemy single who was going for your teammate. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no-action they full save rushed outside while you went ramp. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, didn’t communicate with teammate about nading door before throwing made caused 46 damage to teammate, solid kill on the enemies pushing ramp to trophy room, but unfortunate positioning on ramp when trying to deal with the enemy flanking as your position was known and expected this allowed them to prefire you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid first kill on the enemy ramp, but standing too long in the same spot allowed you to get spammed by another enemy ramp doing a lot of damage, unfortunate engagements against the second enemy, with the holding mistakes and dropping useless utility, also strafing out into the open when on extremely low hp, as well as mollying yourself. L</li>
                    <li>P250 buy, bad fight on the enemy heaven, bad pathing into mouth caused you to be open from A site, fortunately you were able to do substainal damage to them and allowed your teammate to get a quick trade. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfortunate peek into ramp, the enemy was holding the angle with a deagle and juan deaged you, not much you could do. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good use of utility to force a fight you were ready for and perfect crosshair placement led to a quick kill, unfortunately you were not ready for the second close right. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Unfortunate timing on your teammate leaving ramp as they do a ramp push. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Decent crosshair placement as you were somewhat ready for the peek ontop of boxes ramp, but unfortunate movement timing and slightly unfocused peeks allow him to get the kill. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, good communication of strat and mostly well executed but because of noise they were able to spray you through the smoke quite accurately and get you and a teammate. L</li>
                    <li>CT Pistol armour, unfortunate positioning on site, I would have recommended staying heaven as going to A site pillars allows the enemies to get very close very quickly and this is where they are their most deadly. L</li>
                    <li>P250 armour, unfortunate teammate damage, good idea to bring the fight close range but pathing was too close to your teammate which allowed the enemy Mac-10 to get a very easy double spray down. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid first kill on the enemy outside, but I would have recommended changing position after the first kill as when you got peeked by his teammate he was ready for your exact position. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, dangerous peeks taken with the Famas as they are too long range, the famas is especially weak at a distance and acts more as an upgraded SMG than a Rifle as you will always lose at distance to a M4/AK/Galiel. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, Solid damage from rafters getting 1 kill and doing a lot of damage to the second unfortunately your position wasn’t optimal as you were completely exposed to the enemies coming out Hut and Squeaky and you had no cover. L</li>
                    <li>p250, Ramp rush, good job picking up the AK and getting a kill, unfortunately, they dunked a nade onto you and your teammates. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, Good understanding to look at the gaps of a smoke for any enemies trying to be sneaky and using it to your advantage, Heaven trying to take a fight into yard isn’t a good idea as the vast majority of gun-fights you would take would put you at a severe disadvantage. W</li>
                    <li>Ak buy, connection issues so I was unable to properly view this round. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, peek into hut from the same angle allowed the enemy to hit a pretty good prefire on you killing you before you could react. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, repositioning on Ramp was dangerous while blind didn’t fall back, good movement in order to take another engagement deeper into trophy room and a very nice burst landed you a kill. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, positioning on box was good in the beginning but because you stayed there for so long without getting any more information this allowed the enemies to know your exact position and allowed them to get super close which got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Peeked into trophy room to throw a grenade this could have easily gotten you killed if an enemy was peeking, weird positioning on B ramp as this is extremely exposed if an enemy is in double they can peek you if the enemy single pushed out they can kill you and if they peeked control room they can peek you, unfortunate reposition on B while not keeping quite allowed the enemy double to know your exact position and when you peeked into them they were ready for you. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, good job baiting for your teammate but because you stayed in a position very close to where you were last spotted you got double-naded for full damage. L</li>
                    <li> Famas buy, Peeking outside from heaven with the Famas is very dangerous, solid peek into ramp off of the information your teammate provided you getting an early pick, interesting rotation down vents through B site and back up ramp when the enemies positions where A. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, Bad squeaky molly landed top Hut and wouldn’t have stopped a push, solid quick peek down ramp getting the final kill. W </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you during that game, positions you wanted/ comfortable in real life? <br> IRL very comfortable / Felt there were a few positions you didn’t want to play</li>
                    <li>How did your crosshair placement feel? <br> Shaky, sometimes it was really good, but a few times it was very bad </li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel? <br> Felt okay but didn’t feel as natural as it normally does, </li>
                    <li>How did your overall aim mechanics feel, like spraying, flicking, preaiming ect? <br> Preaiming on certain parts of the map felt good but in other places wasn’t good.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement feel? <br> Dropping heaven and rotating through vent to B site and ramp was unnescary, but overall felt pretty alright.</li>
                    <li>How did your positioning feel? <br> T side felt better than CT, time when peeking outside from heaven. </li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br> Overall felt pretty good but sometimes unnecessary utility</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving correct information? <br> 99% of them were good, and sometimes got sounds wrong. </li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> Playing with all of them again. </li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br> Crosshair placement and mostly on heaven. </li>
